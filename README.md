## Digital Expressionism 

{functional_soup} explores how technology can create meaningful theatrical disruption while building community engagement. We draw from expressionist traditions of distortion and Brechtian principles of alienation to develop open-source tools for contemporary theatre.

## Core Approach

We believe theatrical technology should be visible, questioning, and accessible. Our work focuses on:

### Digital Alienation
Technology that reveals its presence and encourages critical engagement through intentional disruption and visible mechanisms.

### Expressive Technology
Tools that transform human movement and emotion into digital forms, emphasizing abstraction and psychological expression.

### Collective Engagement
Frameworks that enable community technological literacy and collaborative creation in theatrical spaces.

## Contributing

We welcome artists, technologists, and community members interested in exploring unconventional approaches to theatrical technology. See CONTRIBUTING.md for engagement guidelines.
